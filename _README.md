Hi, I'm **Lucas**, an electronics engineer, roboticist, classical guitarist, and autistic individual.

I'm a **senior Machine Learning Engineer** at Hurb, a Brazilian travel company. I lead the experimentation program, developing a culture of experimentation within the company. 

Starting this fall, I will be a **master's student at the University of Alberta**, where I will focus my research on reinforcement learning.

<div class="admonition tip rounded" style="flex: 1; display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
<p class="admonition-title">Why?</p>
<p>I began writing as a way to deepen my understanding of the topics I was studying, approaching them as if I were explaining them to myself. This blog is a reflection of that journey, a place where I can share my passion for learning and exploration.</p>
