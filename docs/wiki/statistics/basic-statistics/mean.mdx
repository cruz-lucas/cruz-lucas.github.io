# Mean, Variance, and Expected Values
These are fundamental concepts in statistics that describe the central tendency and variability of a probability distribution.

## Mean
The mean, $\mu$, of a probability provides a measure of the central tendency. For a discrete random variable $$X$$ with a probability mass function $$\mathbb{P}(x)$$:

$$
\mu = \sum_X x \cdot \mathbb{P}(x)
$$

For a continuous random variable $$X$$ with a probability density function $$f(x)$$:

$$
\mu = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx
$$

The mean can also be expressed in term of the **expected value**, i.e. the weighted average value of all possible outcomes of the random variable.

$$
\mu = E(X)
$$

## Variance
Variance measures the spread or dispersion of a set of values. It is the expected value of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean.

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \sigma^2 = E[(X - \mu)^2]
$$

$$
\sigma^2 = 
\begin{cases}
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty(x-\mu)^2f(x)\,dx  & \text{$x$ continuous}\\
    \sum_X (x-\mu)^2\mathbb{P}(x) & \text{$x$ discrete}
\end{cases}
$$

## Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the dispersion in the same units as the mean.

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}
$$
