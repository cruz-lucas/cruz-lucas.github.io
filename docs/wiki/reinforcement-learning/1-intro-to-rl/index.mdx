# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

This documentation is designed to be an additional resource for students and a reliable, interactive knowledge base for anyone interested in reinforcement learning (RL). 

It covers the [Reinforcement Learning MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) by professors Adam and Martha White, as well as additional content from the University of Alberta's CMPUT 655 and CMPUT 365 courses, the latter of which I am a teaching assistant.

:::warning
For a more comprehensive understanding of the topics covered, I highly recommend the textbook [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Sutton and Barto, and checking out the MOOC.
