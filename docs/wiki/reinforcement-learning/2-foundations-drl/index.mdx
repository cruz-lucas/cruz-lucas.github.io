# Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning

This content is a direct translation of the [Foundations of Deep RL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRJQ4m4UJjNymuBM9RdmB3Z9N5-0IlY0) lecture series, from professor Pieter Abbeel's YouTube channel.

For a more detailed coverage of the topics, **I highly recommend watching the original videos.**

This lecture series is designed to **build a strong foundation in deep reinforcement learning**, enabling students, such as myself, to understand current developments and pursue their own research and applications in the field of Reinforcement Learning.
