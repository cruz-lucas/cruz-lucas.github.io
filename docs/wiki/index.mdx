# Wiki

Welcome to the Wiki page! Here you'll find my writtings and resources collected about reinforcement learning, statistics and general machine learning.

## Why?
I began writing as a way to deepen my understanding of the topics I was studying, approaching them as if I were explaining them to myself. This blog is a reflection of that journey, a place where I can share my passion for learning and exploration.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious student, or someone with a love for learning, I hope you'll find value in my writings.

**Feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas. Make yourself at home.**
