# Designing Machine Learning Systems

This content is a summary and my personal takeaways from the excellent book [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/) by Chip Huyen. It reflects the points I found most relevant along with my own conclusions on the topics discussed.

For a more comprehensive coverage of the topics, **I highly recommend reading the full book**.
