# Sampling and Sampling Distributions
Sampling involves selecting a subset of data from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole population.

## Sampling Distribution
The sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic (such as the sample mean) obtained from a large number of samples drawn from a specific population.

## Central Limit Theorem
The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually $ n = 30 $).

$$
\bar{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})
$$
