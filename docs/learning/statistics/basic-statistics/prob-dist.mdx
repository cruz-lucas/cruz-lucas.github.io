# Probability Distributions
A probability distribution describes how the values of a random variable are distributed. It gives the probability that a random variable will take on each of its possible values.

## Types of Probability Distributions
### Discrete Probability Distributions

Include probability mass functions (PMFs) which assign probabilities to discrete outcomes, such that:

$$
\begin{gather}
    0 \le \mathbb{P}(x) \le 1 \qquad \forall x \\
    \mathbb{P}(x=y)=\mathbb{P}(y) \qquad \forall y \\
    \sum_X \mathbb{P}(x) = 1
\end{gather}
$$

For example:

- **Bernoulli Distribution:** The Bernoulli distribution describes experiments that have binary outcomes, e.g., result in either a success or a failure.
  - **Example:** Flipping a coin once, where heads is considered a success.
  - **Formula:**
      
      $$
      \mathbb{P}(x = k) = p^k (1-p)^{1-k} \quad \forall k \in \{0,1\}
      $$

    Where $p$ is the probability of success, $1-p$ is the probability of failure, and $k$ can be either 0 (failure) or 1 (success).


- **Poisson Distribution:** The Poisson distribution describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space when these events happen independently of each other and at a constant rate.
  - **Example:** The number of emails you receive in an hour.
  - **Formula:**
      
      $$
      \mathbb{P}(x = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
      $$

    Where $\lambda$ is the average number of events in the interval, $k$ is the number of occurrences, and $e$ is the Euler's constant.


### Continuous Probability Distributions

Include probability density functions (PDFs) which describe the likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within a particular range of values, such that:

    $$
    \begin{gather}
        0 \le f(x) \\
        \mathbb{P}(a \le x \le b) = \int_a^b f(x) \,dx \\
        \int_\infty^{-\infty} f(x) \,dx = 1
    \end{gather}
    $$

    For example:
  
- **Uniform Distribution:** The uniform distribution describes an equal probability for all values within a specified range.
  - **Example:** The probability of randomly selecting a number between 1 and 10.
  - **Formula:**
  
    $$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases} 
    \frac{1}{b-a} & \text{for } a \leq x \leq b \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    $$

    Where $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and maximum values of the range.

- **Normal Distribution:** The normal distribution, often referred to as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, describes data that clusters around a mean.
  - **Example:** Heights of people in a population.
  - **Formula:**
    
    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
    $$

    Where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

- **Student's t-Distribution:** The Student's t-distribution is used to estimate population parameters when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown.
  - **Example:** The distribution of the sample mean for small sample sizes.
  - **Formula:**
  
    $$
    f(x) = \frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{\nu+1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\nu \pi} \Gamma \left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}
    $$

    Where $\nu$ is the degrees of freedom, and $\Gamma$ the gamma function.
