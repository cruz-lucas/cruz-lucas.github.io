# Random Variable
A random variable is a variable whose values depend on outcomes of a random process. It is a mathematical function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in a sample space of a random experiment.

**Definition**

A random variable $\mathcal{X}$ is a function from the sample space $\Omega$ to the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$:

$$
 \mathcal{X}: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$


**Types of Random Variables:**
- **Discrete Random Variable:** Takes specific, discrete values.
  - **Example:** The number of heads when flipping a coin 10 times. You can get 0, 1, 2, ..., or 10 heads, but not 3.5 heads.
- **Continuous Random Variable:** Takes on an infinite number of possible values.
  - **Example:** The time it takes to run a race. It could be 12.3 seconds, 12.31 seconds, 12.315 seconds, etc.
