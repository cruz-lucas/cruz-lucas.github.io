Hi, I'm **Lucas**, an electronics engineer, roboticist, classical guitarist, and autistic individual.

I'm a **senior Machine Learning Engineer** at Hurb, a Brazilian travel company. I lead the experimentation program, developing a culture of experimentation within the company. 

Starting this fall, I will be a **master's student at the University of Alberta**, where I will focus my research on reinforcement learning.


## What is this?
This is my personal notebook and second brain. Here, you'll find my thoughts on various topics, from reinforcement and machine learning to statistics and beyond.


## Why?
I began writing as a way to deepen my understanding of the topics I was studying, approaching them as if I were explaining them to myself. This blog is a reflection of that journey, a place where I can share my passion for learning and exploration.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious student, or someone with a love for learning, I hope you'll find value in my writings.

**Feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas. Make yourself at home.**
