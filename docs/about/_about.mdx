## What is this?
This is my personal notebook and second brain. Here, you'll find my thoughts on various topics, from reinforcement and machine learning to statistics and beyond.


## Why?
I began writing as a way to deepen my understanding of the topics I was studying, approaching them as if I were explaining them to myself. This blog is a reflection of that journey, a place where I can share my passion for learning and exploration.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious student, or someone with a love for learning, I hope you'll find value in my writings.
