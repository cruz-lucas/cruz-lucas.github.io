Welcome to my research documentation page!

As a master's student at the University of Alberta, my research will focus on model-based Reinforcement Learning, specifically trying to merge some methods of MBRL to develop better exploration strategies.

This documentation serves as a chronicle of my journey through this research. Here, you will find summaries and analyses of the papers I read, detailed records of the experiments I conduct, and references that have influenced my work. Additionally, as I contribute to the field through my publications, those works will be documented and discussed here.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the information here valuable.
